 - How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It was much easier and faster to locate the error and correct it! Love it.

 - How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would allow you to see and "relearn" your mistakes. It would also allow someone to comealong and see your progress and learn from it.

 - What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

The pros of having it saved automatically is: that in the event you forget to save your changes and you close out of the app or there is a sudden power loss, you have something you can restore to. The pro of doing it manually: is that you update versions on the file and not wasted space.

 - Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I'm not sure why there are some version control systems like that. The only reason I can think of, is to save space.

 - How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

You can use them to see the changes made to different files

 - How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It would allow you to make the changes freely, you knowing that you would be able to revert the changes back if it did break something.

 - Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

All my programming needs! I want to see what it is capable of!
