 - What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It created a ".git" folder. I need it so that I can start to track my commits?

 - How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area works on repository, by getting files ready to be committed. It allows you to only commit the files that need to be committed.

 - How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By using that command "git status"
