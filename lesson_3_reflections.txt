 - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you would like to keep a backup just in case your machine goes down, or if you have multiple users accessing the same repo.

 - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might be in the middle of working in the repo and you wouldn't want it to auto over-write what you are working on. Or maybe someone introduced a bug in the last commit and you wouldn't want that on the files that you are currently working on.

 - Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is when you "clone/copy" a repo from the GitHub website. Clones are when you copy a repo, usually on a local machine. Branches are when you take a file and you commit it to a different header.

 - What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit is that you are able to keep track if there have been any changes to the repo in GitHub by other users, and if there are changes you are aware before you push anything back.
