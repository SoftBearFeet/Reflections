 - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you would like to keep a backup just in case your machine goes down, or if you have multiple users accessing the same repo.

 - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might be in the middle of working in the repo and you wouldn't want it to auto over-write what you are working on. Or maybe someone introduced a bug in the last commit and you wouldn't want that on the files that you are currently working on.

 - Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is when you "clone/copy" a repo from the GitHub website. Clones are when you copy a repo, usually on a local machine. Branches are when you take a file and you commit it to a different header.

 - What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit is that you are able to keep track if there have been any changes to the repo in GitHub by other users, and if there are changes you are aware before you push anything back.

 - How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

If I didn't use Git ot GitHub and I needed to collaborate with people, it would really depend if they were local in my are or not. You could use flashdrives, or email, or even Google docs if it was just a simple document. Possibly some sort of cloud service or some other service similar to Git and GitHub. I'm not sure what would be easier because I just am not familiar with the different services offered out there.

 - When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Usually when you are introducing a new feature or correcting a bug. I feel that if there is a typo, that it would be ok to work on it in the master. The benefit is that everyone can see the change before it is merged into the master file, that have the other people put their two cents in.
